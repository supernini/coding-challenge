Welcome to our coding challenge

###Guidelines

The following challenge requires you to successfully submit a login form via an API call. Your code should be written on a new Git branch named "feature/solution". Your form should also include form validation with proper error messages. You do not need to implement any server-side logic apart from a route to catch the response and log the submitted data.

Osedea has developed a library to help with form validation. We encourage you to use it for your implementation:

    - https://github.com/Osedea/angular-osd-form

We've started an angular module for you in /public/javascripts/app.js. You can use this module for binding the form data.

Feel free to refactor this project however you feel is necessary.

###Getting started
    - Install dependencies using `npm install`
    - Start express sever using `npm start`
